## To create a new recipe

1.  Navigate to the recipes directory, and then the category where you
    want to add a recipe.
    
1.  Click the "new file" button at the top right: ![](images/file-buttons.png)

1.  In the "name your file..." box, ![](images/file-name.png), 
    type the name of the recipe. This should be:
    
    * brief
    * all in lower case
    * use `-` to separate words
    * end in `.md`

1.  Enter the recipe in the large edit box. Most recipes have three sections:
 
    ```
    # This is the title
    
    * Each ingredient is 
    * listed on
    * a line that starts with an asterisk
    
    The method is listed below.
    ```
    
    You can click preview to check that everything is formatted correctly.

1.  Write "Adding new recipe" in the (small) first box under

    so there's nothing you can do that can't be undone.
