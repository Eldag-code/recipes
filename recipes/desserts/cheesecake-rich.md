CRUST:
1/2 c flour
2 T sugar
50g cold butter
1 egg yolk
FILLING:
750g (3 cartons) cream cheese
1 c sugar
3 T flour
1 t vanilla
1 t fine grated citrus rind
3 eggs
2 T milk

To make the crust, either combine the first three ingredients in the food processor, mix until butter is finely chopped then add egg yolk and mix to a dough or rub or cut butter into dry ingredients, then add egg yolk and mix with a fork until combined.

Press mixture onto the bottom of a buttered or sprayed loose bottomed cake tin, 20 or 23 cm in diameter.  Bake base at 200 C for 5 minutes.

Soften cream cheese in a warm room or in a microwave oven (each carton warms in 30-60 seconds).  Blend softened cream cheese with the sugar, flour, vanilla and very finely grated lemon, orange or tangelo rind, then add the eggs and milk and beat until evenly smooth.  Use a food processor if available, or mix first by hand then using a beater, in a large mixing bowl.

Pour onto the partially cooked base.  Bake at 200 C for 15 minutes, then at 150 C for 45-60 minutes, until a pointed knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Leave to stand for 30 minutes then run a sharp knife around the sides of the tin and remove leaving the cheesecake sitting on the base of the tin.
