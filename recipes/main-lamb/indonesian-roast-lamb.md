Tie roast if necessary.  Put in an unpunctured bag with the next seven ingredients.  Marinate at least 1/2 hour, or up to two days. 

Take roast from marinade.  Heat marinade with the peanut butter and water until thick and bubbly to make the glaze.

Roast meat at 170C for 1-1.5 hours, as desired, brushing with glaze during last 10 minutes.  

To microwave, brush uncooked roast with glaze.  Cook at 50% to 50% power level, to an internal temperature of 70C, and about 15 minutes for each 750g.  Allow to stand for 10 minutes.  Slice and pour glaze, thinned if necessary, over meat.
