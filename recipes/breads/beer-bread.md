From: Dan Nettleton

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 tsp. baking powder
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 3 Tbsp. sugar
* 1 (12 oz.) can beer
* 2-3 Tbsp. melted margarine

Grease loaf pan.  Mix dry ingredients.  Add beer and mix.  Put dough
in loaf pan.  Pour melted margarine over dough and bake 55 minutes at

Alternate recipe:  Instead of 3 Tbsp. sugar, add 3/4 cup brown sugar,
