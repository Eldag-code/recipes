1.  Trim outer skin and any fat or gristle from beef.  Cut meat into rectangles about 50mm by 60mm, or leave rounds of shin on bone.  Place in casserole.
2.  Combine tomato sauce, water, soy sauce, honey, and optional garlic or fresh ginger.  Pour over meat.
3.  Cover casserole well and cook slowly at 150 C for about three hours or until beef is tender.  Thicken if desired with flour (or cornflour) mixed to a light paste with cold water.  Stir in paste and simmer for 10 minutes.
4.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and service with mashed potatoes, brown rice or noodles, and a green vegetable.
